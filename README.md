# Tight

## About
**This package is under development and probably shouldn't be used yet. Feel free to experiment with it, however.**

Tight, is a really tiny and light PHP framework, for those occasions when Laravel or Symfony are too much.

Currently it depends upon `bramus/router` for routing and `twig/twig` for template rendering.

## Installation

```
composer create-project asdfx/tight -s dev
```
